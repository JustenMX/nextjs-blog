          Greetings! As an associate software engineer, I bring relevant working
          experiences in the IT industry and a passion for programming. With
          experience in Javascript, React, ViteJS, Python, MERN stack and
          Software Project Management, I am equipped with a strong foundation in
          software development principles and project management. In addition to
          my current skill sets, I am currently expanding my knowledge and skill
          sets in Java and C++. I am also exploring low-code development
          platforms like Mendix to further my understanding of innovative
          solutions in the software development landscape.
        </p>
